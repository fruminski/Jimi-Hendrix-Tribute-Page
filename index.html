          <h2>Jimi Hendrix</h2>
          <div class="dates">
              <p>November 27, 1942 in Seattle, Washington, U.S.</p>
              <p>September 18, 1970, London, England</p>
          </div>
          <p>American rock guitarist, singer, and composer who fused American traditions of blues, jazz, rock, and soul with techniques of British avant-garde rock to redefine the electric guitar in his own image. Widely recognized as one of the most creative and influential musicians of the 20th century, Jimi Hendrix pioneered the explosive possibilities of the electric guitar. 
          </p>
          <p> Hendrix&#39;s innovative style of combining fuzz, feedback and controlled distortion created a new musical form. Because he was unable to read or write music, it is nothing short of remarkable that Jimi Hendrix&#39;s meteoric rise in the music took place in just four short years. His musical language continues to influence a host of modern musicians, from George Clinton to Miles Davis, and Steve Vai to Jonny Lang.</p>

          <h3>A few interesting facts about Jimi Hendrix</h3>
          
          <ol>
              <li>
                  <h4>Jimi was not his actual name</h3>
                  <p>Hendrix&#39;s birth name was John Allen Hendrix. After his father returned from the Second World War, he corrected the name to James Marshall Hendrix.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <h4>Hendrix died at the age of 27</h3>
                  <p>Unfortunately, Jimi Hendrix died tragically at the very young age of 27 years. He died in London, his death being caused by Asphyxia due to aspiration of vomit; contributed to by barbiturate intoxication.</p>
              </li>
              <li>   
                  <h4>Hendrix played his guitar upside down</h3>
                  <p>Jimi Hendrix was a left-handed person. When he got his first guitar, he simply rearranged the strings which meant that other than the strings, all the other features of the guitar were upside down. A left-handed person using a right-handed guitar or vice versa is considered almost impossible as many guitarists spend a lot of time pondering which guitar is best for them and most comfortable to make the playing experience as smooth as possible.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <h4>Hendrix&#39;s fame did not grow from his motherland</h3>
                  <p>Jimi Hendrix was born in the United States of America where he lived a better part of his life. However, his music expertise was not recognized in his motherland until he visited Britain. In the United Kingdom, he did small tours of clubs which was equally enough to create a local notice and make him become the talk of the town. He became famous in a very short period. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <h4>Hendrix released 3 records.</h3>
                  <p>It is very unusual for an influential musician like Hendrix Jimi to have this number of studio records. In his case, it is reasonable for he died at the age of 27 and thus did not live long to do more of what he was very much qualified in.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <h4>Hendrix joined the army in form of a punishment</h3>
                  <p>Jimi Hendrix was caught twice riding in stolen cars when he was hardly 19 years old. For this, he was given the choice of punishment; to be jailed for a certain period or to join the army, where he chose to join the army and was shipped to Fort Campbell in Kentucky.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <h4>Jimi Hendrix could not read music</h3>
                  <p>Jimi Hendrix was a self-taught musician and had no theoretical knowledge of music. He explained this by saying that he used his ear to play and often used words or colors to express what he wanted to communicate. For example, he said that purple shows jealousy, or anger while green shows envy. This is how Hendrix ended up playing music perfectly with no theoretical understanding.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <h4>Hendrix burned his guitar after performing in a sort of sacrifice.</h3>
                  <p>At the end of the performance at Monterey Pop Festival, he set his guitar on fire in a sort of sacrifice to show the dedication of the day&#39;s performance.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <h4>An apartment in London is named after Hendrix</h3>
                  <p>The London, an apartment located in the city’s Mayfair neighborhood where Jimi Hendrix began his career, was restored to what it would have looked like when Jimi lived there for one year and reopened as a museum in 2016.</p>
